# problem statement

Now a days the most of the information regarding education ,news, work are available in internet
.But the predominantly illiterate communities and the visually impaired community face issues to
read that data .even the students who studied in regional medium school will face issues while
reading online resources. The senior citizens face issue during reading book due to their vision .
So the app we have developed as a team highlights some of the most useful features which play an
important role in the predominantly illiterate communities , the visually impaired community, senior
citizens and travelers as well.

# primary reason to choose this particular problem:

We havenâ€™t seen a proper solution for above stated issues in real world and visually impaired
people are facing lot of issue during this Pandemic situation because except libraries the
Braille books are not available any where so we started working to resolve this problem
with our available resources

# main objective of the project:
To develop a application which can translate English texted pdf ,word file ,image to user
custom language and give him in format document(docx) or mp3( according to user
requirement)
And we want to add feature to translate any language text input to user custom language
(so it can used by user while texting to foreigners)
