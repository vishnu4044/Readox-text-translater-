# Readox :Text translate Application.


# problem statement

Now a days the most of the information regarding education ,news, work are available in internet
.But the predominantly illiterate communities and the visually impaired community face issues to
read that data .even the students who studied in regional medium school will face issues while
reading online resources. The senior citizens face issue during reading book due to their vision .
So the app we have developed as a team highlights some of the most useful features which play an
important role in the predominantly illiterate communities , the visually impaired community, senior
citizens and travelers as well.

# primary reason to choose this particular problem:

We haven’t seen a proper solution for above stated issues in real world and visually impaired
people are facing lot of issue during this Pandemic situation because except libraries the
Braille books are not available any where so we started working to resolve this problem
with our available resources

# main objective of the project:
To develop a application which can translate English texted pdf ,word file ,image to user
custom language and give him in format document(docx) or mp3( according to user
requirement)
And we want to add feature to translate any language text input to user custom language
(so it can used by user while texting to foreigners)

# Scope of the Project:
● Translates text of any document type like pdf ,word ,image to any other desired
language and give in form of document type .
● It just doesn’t confirm convert to document format but can also read the document and
voice translator in the application reads out the document in any language to which it
wanted to be translated.
● It has a additional feature that if text from any language is given as input in the
application it will translates the text to any desired language.
● It will be very helpful for Blind people, illiterate and also for people who wants to
understand the meaning in other languages and can’t understand or read English

# Working Methodology

Readox is basically web application here we are using python for backend and html , css
,java script for frontend


When user’s use our application the request will be taken by hosting servers and send
request service folder to generate unique id and it will create two folder with unique name
then it will start process in first folder and pass output to second folder and this second
folder files will down loaded in user mobile . generated and uploaded files will be deleted
from server after completion of user download .

# Hardware &amp; Software used:
Python(flask) -used for backend
Html , Css , java script -used to design front end
Pythonanywhere – for Hosting purpose
Kodular software used to create app interface for web application
# Specify the contribution that the App would make:
It would help visually impaired people to read resources from internet by converting files to
mp3 format.
It help people to break the barriers of communication while texting.
It help people who studied in regional mediums by converting books to their native language
to get knowledge.
It also help senior citizens to read online books

# Conclusion:

We developed an application which can read text from pdf ,word document , image and
translate to user custom language and give him in docx or mp3 format( according to user
requirement)with this kind of features it will be helpful for the predominantly illiterate
communities , visually impaired community and the students who studied in regional
medium schools. And we add a feature called text translate which can translate any language
text to user custom language . so it will be useful for the people while texting with foreigners
Note: To the best of our knowledge this is the first application with this kind of features.
